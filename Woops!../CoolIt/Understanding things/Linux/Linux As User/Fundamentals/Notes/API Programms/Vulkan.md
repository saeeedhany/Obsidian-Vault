Vulkan and **[[Directx11]]** are both APIs (application programming interfaces). An **[[API]]** is a program meant to help two programs or a program and hardware to communicate with each other. Works short of like a waiter in a restaurant: a customer in a restaurant (your game) wants something very spesific done by the kitchen (your hardware). The customer can't go straight to kitchen to tell them what it wants to be done. The need a waiter (API). API will then take a customers request to the kitchen, kitchen makes a meal and waiter returns to the customer with a meal. Vulkan and Directx11 are both different kind of waiters. Vulkan is a bit faster but sometimes trips and throws your meal on the floor; Directx11 is slower but more reliable. Directx11's speed can not be improved, but Vulkan's stability can. Larian wants to get feedback about Vulkan to improve the stability, hence why it's a default API right now. If Vulkan works well, use it, the performance will be slightly better. But if it doesn't, switch to Directx11.
