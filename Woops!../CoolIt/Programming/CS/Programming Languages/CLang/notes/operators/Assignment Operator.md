- **Use Case** - It used to assign values to a [[variables]].
- It requires two values - **L-value** and **R-value**.
- The operator copies **R-value** to **L-value**.

### Shorthand assignment operators
- **+=** First addition than assignment.
- **-=**  First subtraction that assignment.
- **=**  First multiplication assignment.  _**note**_ - the "=" it preceded by * .
- _**/=**_ First division than assignment.
- **%=** First modulus than assignment.
- **<<=** First bitwise left shift than assignment.
- **>>=** First bitwise right shift that assignment.
- **&=** First bitwise And than assignment.
- **|=** First bitwise OR than assignment.
- **^=** First bitwise XOR than assignment.

**Note -** Assignment operator is having least precedence except the comma operator.

##### Example: 
```
if a += 1      //this is equivalent to a = a + 1;
```
**Note -** Similar concept for other shorthand assignment operators as well.
