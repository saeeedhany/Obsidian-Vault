*Types Of Computer Systems based on number of General Purpose Processors* :
- Single Processor Systems
- Multiprocessor Systems
- Clustered System

# Single Processor System :

-> One main CPU capable of executing a general purpose instruction set including instructions from user processor.

-> Other special purpose processors are also present which perform device specific tasks.

# Multiprocessor System :

-> Also known as *Parallel System* or *Tightly Coupled Systems*.

-> Has two or more processor in close communication, sharing the computer bus and sometimes the clock, memory, and peripheral devices.

**Advantages** :
- Increase Throughput. (Performance)
- Economy of Scale. 
- Increase Reliability.

**<center>Types of Multiprocessor Systems :</center>**
-> Symmetric Multiprocessing
-> Asymmetric Multiprocessing

# Clustered Systems :

-> Like multiprocessor systems, clustered systems gather together multiple CPUs to accomplish computational work.

-> They are composed of two or more individual system coupled together.

-> provides high availability.

-> It can also be structured as *Asymmetrically* of *Symmetrically*.
- Asymmetrically : 
	- One machine in Host-Standby mode.
	- Other run application.
- Symmetrically :
	- Two or more hosts run applications.
	- Monitors each other.
