![[Memory Hierarchy.canvas|Memory Hierarchy]]
**!!** The Cost Per Bit decreases down ..
So - From top to bottom we have - 

--> **Registers -**
- it is the smallest storage devices.
- And it store data per **bits**

--> **Cache -**
- The size of the cache is a little bit bigger than the cache.
- but it is speed is bigger than the register also a little bit.

--> **Main memory -** 
- Also known as [[Random Access memory (RAM)]].

--> **Electronic Disk**, **Magnetic Disk**, **Optical Disk**, **Magnetic Tapes**.
- These all are the *Secondary storage devices*.

*So based on this hierarchy when we go **UP** it becomes **Expensive** but they are **Fast**, and then the size also become **Smaller** as you go up the hierarchy*.

*The **Cost per bit increases** and the **Access time increases** and **there size also increases***.

--> Calling back the **main memory** to understand it..
- In the main memory, anything that we load in your computer gets loaded to your main memory.
> So things are stored in your **secondary memory** but things are loaded in your **main memory**.

--> So what do we mean by **secondary memory** ??
> Before that we need to know that the **main memory** it's fast but it's size is limited.
- in *secondary memory* we can store all our data and all other things that we need and when it has to be loaded or executed it is loaded into the *main memory* and then executed.

*so when we have more of **(RAM)** our computer will works fast*.

**!!** Now we will talk about the **Volatile** and **Non Volatile**.
--> **Volatile -**  Register, Cash, Main Memory.
- Loses its content when the power is removed.


--> **Non Volatile -** Electronic Disk, Magnetic Disk, Optical Disk, Magnetic Tapes.
- Retains its contents even when the power is removed.
